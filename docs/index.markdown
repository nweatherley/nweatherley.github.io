Hi - I'm a Senior Software Engineer with a broad skill set across multiple languages. My main workhorse currently is in Python 3, with a focus on high-performance computing through multiprocessing and multithreading. I enjoy working on optimizations and vague problems the most.

Outside of work, I enjoy coffee roasting and exploring new technologies. I'm always open to connecting!
